# Encrypt-and-decrypt-the-data-using-RSA-algorithm
➢RSA involves a public and private key , the public key can be known to everyone ; it is used to 
encrypt messages.
➢ Messages encrypted using the public key can be decrypted with the private key.
➢ Its security is based on the difficulty of factoring large integers.
➢ The CRC is powerful, detect many types of errors, extremely fast to calculate especially when 
dedicated hardware chips are used.
